COVID19 HealthMap is a Geographic Information System (GIS) project that analyzes the spatial distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases and examines their relationship with population and healthcare infrastructure.

The project integrates spatial data, performs geospatial analysis, and applies a machine learning model to understand patterns in COVID-19 spread across states.
